    "**Instructions:** All answers should be provided in the notebook and then submitted to Moodle. Name of notebook should be in following format:\n",
    " - Name_group_Assignment1.ipynb (ex. Harry_Potter_2009_Assignment1.ipynb). PLEASE, use exactly the **same format.**\n",
    " - Try to use fewer cells for compilation (for example, you can use print for several answers, instead of printing each answer on a separate cell)\n",
    " - **PLEASE:** submit only one jupyter notebook (no zip or csv files) and with your names as in the instruction. Ohterwise, there will be punishment of 30% from your assignment mark.\n",
    " - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** you will get points only for correct answers, not for trials or wrong answers. Your notebook should run when we press **\"Restart Kernel\"** and then press **\"Run All\"**. We are going to check answers only after doing that. If your code do not compile and stops at any question, you will get zero for that question."
